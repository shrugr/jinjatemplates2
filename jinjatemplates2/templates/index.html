		Hello dear surfer of the inter webs!. Welcome to my slice of cyber space.I am a homo sapien who loves food-which homo sapien doesn't?. If it weren't for food I wouldn't be alive and nor would you(unless you are an alien). I am very glad I am not an astronaut because that would mean I need to eat dehydrated food in small silver packets. Can you imagine a life more bleak than that?!. Yikes!. Well, I wouldn't mind being an astronaut if I could stop at different planets and eat food there. I wonder what food on Mars would be like. Would it taste the same?. I don't know. On my site you can find food that homo sapiens of this beautiful blue rock planet eat. My alien visitors may find it amusing, but mind you dear friend, you are missing out because you don't have caliculus gustatererius aka what homo sapiens call 'taste buds'  </p>
